# Exercise 1: Profit Margin Calculator

# 1. Prompt the user for revenue and cost
# We wrap input() in float() because input() always returns a string
revenue = float(input("What's the revenue? "))
cost = float(input("What's the cost? "))

# 2. Calculate profit
profit = revenue - cost

# Displaying Revenue and Cost with 1 decimal place first
print(f"\nValues Entered -> Revenue: ${revenue:,.1f} | Cost: ${cost:,.1f}")

# 3. Calculate margin with a check for zero revenue to avoid division errors
if revenue > 0:
    # Profit margin formula: (Profit / Revenue) * 100
    margin = (profit / revenue) * 100
    
    # 4. Print the results formatted nicely
    # We use f-strings for easy formatting:
    # :,.2f adds commas for thousands and rounds to 2 decimal places
    # .2f on margin rounds to 2 decimal places
    print(f"Profit: ${profit:,.2f} | Margin: {margin:.2f}%")
else:

    print("Invalid revenue.")
